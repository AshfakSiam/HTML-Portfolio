<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is K. M. Ashfak Alam Siam, and I'm currently pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Data Science at Miami University. Originally from the vibrant country of Bangladesh, I've always had a passion for technology and data, which led me to explore these fascinating fields. I love delving into the intricacies of coding and data analysis, and I'm excited about the endless possibilities these disciplines offer for innovation and problem-solving.</p>

<p>Outside of academics, I'm an avid sports enthusiast. I enjoy playing soccer and badminton, which keep me active and allow me to unwind after a long day. In addition to sports, I have a creative side that I express through drawing and dancing. These hobbies provide a great balance to my technical pursuits, allowing me to tap into different parts of my personality.</p>

<p>I also have a passion for comedy. Back in Bangladesh, I used to perform stand-up comedy in my native language, and now I'm venturing into doing it in English. It's been a fun challenge to translate my humor and connect with a broader audience. I love making people laugh and believe that comedy is a universal language that can bring people together</p>
